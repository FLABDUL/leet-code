# LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, categorized into different stages of my learning and problem-solving process. Each problem is divided into the following sections:

## Folder Structure

- **`attempt/`**  
  This folder contains my **initial raw attempts** at solving LeetCode problems. These are the first solutions I write without any external references. They represent my thought process and problem-solving approach at the time of first encountering the problem.

- **`practise/`**  
  The `practise/` folder contains my **second attempts** at solving problems after reviewing community solutions. This allows me to apply new insights and refine my solution based on better approaches and optimizations I've learned.

- **`solutions/`**  
  This folder contains **community solutions** and approaches that I have found insightful. These solutions are not my own but are included here for reference and study. They serve as inspiration for improving my understanding and solving techniques.

- **`log/`**  
  The `log/` folder contains my **detailed solutions with logs**, which include:
  - Code with **log lines** to demonstrate how the solution works step-by-step.
  - **Comments** that explain the **pros and cons** of the approach.
  - **Algorithm theory** to discuss the underlying principles of the solution.
  - An analysis of the **space/time complexity** of the solution, offering insights into its efficiency and potential improvements.

## Problem Solving Process

1. **Attempt**  
   I begin by trying to solve each problem on my own. These are raw attempts, where I apply the concepts I already know to tackle the problem. The goal here is to see how far I can get without looking at external solutions.

2. **Practise**  
   After my initial attempt, I review community solutions and approaches to learn new techniques and optimize my code. The practise phase allows me to implement more efficient or refined solutions based on what I've learned.

3. **Log**  
   After solving the problem, I document my approach in the log. This includes adding comments to explain the code, detailing the pros and cons of the solution, and discussing the algorithm theory. I also evaluate the solution in terms of **space** and **time complexity**.

## How to Use This Repository
